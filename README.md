I have created a collection of my TNT duplication designs. There are 2 types of designs here. 

The duplication modules produce the TNT and have 2 types. Stable means updating any block while idle will not break it. Unstable is the opposite and requires a level of caution when and after building.

The compressors move all of each batch(tnt produced at the same time) to the same place when it explodes. This is useful beyond just blowing stuff up.
